## Motivation

According to recent Vietnam university studies on student issues, most students often experience stress and tension. The primary cause is poor time management. Among the surveyed participants, 25% cited frequent unexpected tasks as the main reason, 40% mentioned not having a clear daily schedule, and 35% attributed their struggles to a lack of discipline in following their plans due to various external factors. These include poorly designed schedules leading to disruptions, forgetting important tasks, and feeling overwhelmed when work piles up. These issues have negatively impacted society, with 60% of students surveyed unable to achieve good academic results, 35% wasting time on unproductive activities such as gaming or excessive social engagements, and 45% failing to balance their work and personal lives.

From our observations, traditional tools for time management often fall short in addressing these challenges. These tools primarily focus on basic calendar functions and lack advanced features to help users tackle their complex problems effectively. As a result, users often spend significant time trying to create efficient schedules. While some companies have introduced solutions like AI-powered assistants to address these issues, the setup and synchronization processes can be overly complicated, sometimes reducing their effectiveness.

Our team has envisioned a new tool designed to overcome these challenges. It aims to be convenient, user-friendly, and capable of addressing the majority of time management problems users currently face.
